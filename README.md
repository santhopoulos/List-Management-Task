## 3. Start the Backend Server

In the terminal cd to the "backend" folder and type:

The server will start at http://localhost:3000

## 4. Open the Frontend
In your browser or via live server open "frontend/index.html"

The form includes validation (e.g., name must contain only letters and numbers, email must be valid)
